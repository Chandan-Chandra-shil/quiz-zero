        <p class="text-xl mb-5">The main difference between forEach and filter is that forEach just a loop over the
          array and
          execute the
          callback but
          filter executes the callback and check its return value. If the value is true element remains in the resulting
          array
          but
          if the return value is false the element will be removed for the resulting array.</p>

        <h1 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">2. Difference between local storage session storage and cookies?</h1>
        <br>
        <p class="text-xl">Local storage is useful for storing data that the user will need to access later, such as
          offline data. Session storage
          is a great way to improve the performance of your web applications. Cookies are a good choice for storing data
          that
          should not be persisted for a long time, such as session.</p>

        <h1 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">1. QuizTime function:</h1><br>
        <p class="text-xl">The function takes one parameter"dismiss" which is a boolean value. If dismiss is true, it
          clears the timer using the
          "clearInterval" function and returns from the function.

          If the count is greater than 60 seconds, the function alternates between adding and removing CSS classes to
          change the
          color of the timer display.

          The interval function runs every 1000 milliseconds and will continue running until the clearInterval
          function is called.</p>
        <h1 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">2. ChooseQuiz function:</h1><br>
        <p class="text-xl">The chooseQuiz function is a JavaScript function that is used to update the user's selected
          answer for a quiz question.


          First, the function checks if an answer object with the same id as the current quiz question already exists in
          the
          answers array using the find method.

          If no answer object with the same id exists, the function creates a new answer object using the spread syntax
          to copy
          all properties of the current quiz question object from the quizData array into a new object, and then adds
          the givenAns
          property to the new object with the value of the givenAns parameter. The new answer object is then added to
          the answers
          array using the push method.
