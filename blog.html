            executes the
            callback but
            filter executes the callback and check its return value. If the value is true element remains in the resulting
            array
            but
            if the return value is false the element will be removed for the resulting array.</p>

          is a great way to improve the performance of your web applications. Cookies are a good choice for storing data that
          should not be persisted for a long time, such as session.</p>

        <p class="py-4">The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the
        Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it. Such
        an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.</p>

    <p class="text-2xl" > The function takes one parameter"dismiss" which is a boolean value. If dismiss is true, it clears the timer using the
    "clearInterval" function and returns from the function.
    
    If dismiss is not true, the function creates an interval using the setInterval function. The interval function updates
    the timer display by getting the HTML element with the ID of "count" and setting its innerHTML property to a string that
    represents the current count in minutes and seconds. It also increments the count variable by 1.
    
    If the count is greater than 60 seconds, the function alternates between adding and removing CSS classes to change the
    color of the timer display.
    
    The interval function runs every 1000 milliseconds  and will continue running until the clearInterval
    function is called.</p>
    <h1 class="font-bold text-4xl mb-5">ChooseQuiz Function: </h1>
    <p class="text-2xl">The chooseQuiz function is a JavaScript function that is used to update the user's selected answer for a quiz question.
    It takes two parameters: index and givenAns.
    
    First, the function checks if an answer object with the same id as the current quiz question already exists in the
    answers array using the find method. If an answer object already exists, the function updates the existing object with
    the new givenAns property value by using a for loop to iterate through the answers array and find the matching object.
    Once the matching object is found, the splice method is used to update the object with the new givenAns value.
    
    If no answer object with the same id exists, the function creates a new answer object using the spread syntax to copy
    all properties of the current quiz question object from the quizData array into a new object, and then adds the givenAns
    property to the new object with the value of the givenAns parameter. The new answer object is then added to the answers
    array using the push method.
    
    Finally, the displayAnswers function is called with the updated answers array to display the current set of answers to
    the user.</p>
