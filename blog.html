          <p class="py-4">The main difference between forEach and filter is that forEach just loop over the array and
            executes the
            callback but
            filter executes the callback and check its return value. If the value is true element remains in the resulting
            array
            but
            if the return value is false the element will be removed for the resulting array.</p>

          <p class="py-4">Local storage is useful for storing data that the user will need to access later, such as offline data. Session storage
          is a great way to improve the performance of your web applications. Cookies are a good choice for storing data that
          should not be persisted for a long time, such as session.</p>

        <p class="py-4">The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the
        Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it. Such
        an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.</p>
